# Talks


This repo contains code and pdfs for the talks I give on
an ad-hoc or one-off basis. In order from the most recent 
to least recent. I started collating my talks during the
middle of my PhD in 2022.

### Introduction To Idris and GADTS
  [This](/COMP1130/IntroToIdrisAndGADTS/Talk) 
  was a short guest lecture given to the 2023 Semester 1
  students of the Australian National University's COMP1130
  course. I introduce Generalised Algebraic Data Type (GADT)
  syntax in Haskell, motivate them, and then describe why
  the move to a friendlier language (Idris) is necessary.
  I finish with some examples of dependent types and GADTs
  in Idris.
