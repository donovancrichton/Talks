# Talks


This repo contains code and pdfs for the talks I give on
an ad-hoc or one-off basis. In order from the most recent 
to least recent. I started collating my talks during the
middle of my PhD in early 2023.

## Talk Links
The link to each talk is usually the first word of the 
description.

### Lambda Calculi with Explicit Substitutions
  [This](/BFPG/2025/LambdaCalculiWithExplicitSubstitutions/Talk) was a short talk given to the 
  [Brisbane Functional Programming Group](https://lu.ma/bfpg) about a commonly
  encountered extension to lambda calculi, particularly in higher-order or dependently-typed variants - explicit
  substitutions.

### Enforcing a discipline of Total Functional Programming through Dependent Types
  [This](/BFPG/2024/TotalFPThroughDepTytpes/Talk) was a short talk
  given to the [Brisbane Functional Programming
  Group](https://www.meetup.com/brisbane-functional-programming-group) about how dependent types can be used to practice total functional programming without wrapping all our types in eithers/maybes.

### Why is so much of FP about Types instead of Functions?
  [This](/BFPG/2023/WhyIsFPAboutTypes/Talk) was a short and 
  informal introductory talk given to the [Brisbane Functional Programming
  Group](https://www.meetup.com/brisbane-functional-programming-group) which introduces the notion of a function and 
  describes their limitations, and why types tend to take
  up a surprising amount of the discussion space in
  functional programming communities. I cover Sets,
  Relations, Functions, Algebraic Data
  Types, Type Classes, and Dependent Types.

### Towards Palatable Functional Programming With Dependent Type Theories
  [This](/BFPG/2023/PalatableFunctionalProgrammingWithDTT/Talk)
  was a short and informal talk given to the 
  [Brisbane Functional Programming Group](https://www.meetup.com/brisbane-functional-programming-group) which served as
  a reintroduction of myself to the group after an
  approximate three year absence while I resided in
  Canberra. The talk gives a gentle introduction to the 
  limitations of syntactic totality checking in Idris at 
  the time of writing, and motivates my broad PhD topic: The
  need to investigate type-based approaches to totality and
  guarded recursion, and how this necessitates the proposal
  of a construction of a guarded, observational, linear, 
  dependent type theory to allow us to experiment with
  improving dependently typed languages for programmers.

### Introduction To Idris and GADTS
  [This](/COMP1130/IntroToIdrisAndGADTS/Talk) 
  was a short guest lecture given to the 2023 Semester 1
  students of the Australian National University's COMP1130
  course. I introduce Generalised Algebraic Data Type (GADT)
  syntax in Haskell, motivate them, and then describe why
  the move to a friendlier language (Idris) is necessary.
  I finish with some examples of dependent types and GADTs
  in Idris.
