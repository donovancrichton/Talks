Explicit substitutions are a commonly encountered extension to typed lambda calculi
particularly when working with higher order, or dependently typed variants.
This talk will cover the rationale, syntax and evaluation for explicit substitutions, and 
showcase how they reduce the burden of reasoning about the substitution operation in the meta-theory.

This talk will contain a brief introductory tour of the 
Simply Typed Lambda Calculus, de Bruijn Indices, and Typing Rules that are suitable for
beginners in functional programming, and conclude with a mutually inductive presentation
of explicit substitution over a dependent type theory for more advanced attendees.
