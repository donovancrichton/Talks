\begin{itemize}
  \item How to read (theory) syntax.
  \item STLC - Simply Typed Lambda Calculus.
  \item Substituions in anger - De-Bruijn Indicies.
  \item Explicit Subsitutions.
  \item Explicit Substitutions in modern type theory.
\end{itemize}
Idea: Explicit Subsitutions bridge the gap between theory and 
      implementation for substitution.
