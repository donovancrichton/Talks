## Substitutions Part 2

During Part 1 we covered the syntax for expression grammars, 
typing rules, and the simply typed lambda calculus, 
finishing off with an extended syntax for explicit 
substitutions. 

This talk will extend part 1 by showing how to read (the syntax)
and understand the intended behavior (semantics) of the new
substitution combinators in our extended lambda calculus.
