This talk is part 1 of 2 talks on extending lambda calculi with explicit substitutions.

This a beginner friendly talk which introduces the mathematics behind the Simply Typed Lambda Calculus
(STLC) that underpins the very foundations of all modern pure functional programming languages (ML, Haskell,
Lean, etc). There is a large gap between the STLC on paper, and how it is usually implemented in practice.
Explicit Substitutions give us a way to narrow this gap.

This talk will cover: BNF Grammars, Inference Rules, The STLC, Substitution, β-reduction, α-equivalence, De-Bruijn
Indices, Explicit Substitutions, and finally extending a variant of the STLC with explicit substitutions in
preparation for part 2, which will draw on these concepts as assumed background.
