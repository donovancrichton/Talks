Talk Abstract
---------------
This talk examines one of these idiosyncrasies of 
dependently typed programming, the requirement
for totality. We will see why we have this requirement and 
how the current approach to satisfying this 
requirement is distinctly unpalatable for programmers. 

Donovan will introduce the main thrust of his research, namely
using a type theoretic approach to ensuring totality and outline
the steps needed to take this idea to a working implementation.

Along the way, we will (briefly) examine concepts such as: 
dependent types, type theories, 
extensionality, intensionality, 
induction, co-induction, formalisation or mechanisation, 
and semantics.
