Talk Abstract
---------------
Motivated by some recent heavy use of parser generator
libraries in Haskell, this talk discusses the issues we face
when writing functions for types that are 'too large', and
how we may use dependent types to 'shrink' our types back to
a reasonable size.

Specifically we cover a brief introduction to: the algebra of
types, dependent types, and total functional programming, 
before getting to the main demonstration of using dependent
types to restrict our too large types back to a reasonable
size.

This is an intermediate talk and assumes familiarity with
pure functional programming and Haskell Syntax. It will help
if you've seen dependent types, implicit arguments, or Idris
syntax before.
