Propositions As Types
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This talk will introduce you to an alternative way to think about types and
functions. Under certain conditions your types can be logical propositions and
your functions can be mathematical proofs. Proving a theorem becomes no different
to writing a program in a (particular kind of) pure functional programming language. 
We will explore this notion in the Idris functional programming language and see 
examples of how proofs can be very useful to day-to-day programming.



What do you think of when you hear the word 'type' in the context of programming?

Do you think of a type as a way to tell the compiler how to interpret the set of
bits representing the value, so it can distinguish the letter 'a' from the the
unsigned integer 1100001?

Do you think of a type as a set of values whose elements completely describe
the type?

Both these answers are correct under certain conditions.
